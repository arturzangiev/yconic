I went from mixed math to college math... now what?,Ok so I'm in grade 11 and I always struggled at math so in grade 9 i took applied math. When it came time to choose classes for grade 11 I decided to take mixed math because I thought I could handle it but in the little bit I was there I started to fail by 2 percent. My family and the guidance counselors at my school thought it would be a good idea to switch from mixed to college math and after a lot of contemplation I just said screw it and I made the switch. Now I feel like I just closed so many doors and I feel like I'll never be successful without at least mathematics of data management which is the class you take in grade 13 after you take mixed in grade 11 but now I have to drop math next year and I'm scared I have no options now and that without math I'll work a minimum wage job for the rest of my life or something. I was also thinking about going into business but now no business program is going to accept me without university math. So should I just scrap that plan all together and just graduate high school and apply to a fast food restaurant and work their for the rest of my life?

"Help! Medical Undergrad, MCAT Scores, and Applications","I am seeking help on how applying to university undergrad programs really work. Firstly, I am currently in Grade 11 in the IB program. The admissions for say Dalhousie say that a 3.00 is mandatory, and an MCAT, among other things. Is an MCAT a requirement to apply? And, when do I take it? I have read that if I take it in High School I will be at a disadvantage because I haven't taken the courses yet, but it's listed on the applications pages of many medical undergrad programs. Secondly, how do I find my GPA from an IB score? Do I use my converted Ontario mark to then convert to GPA? Thirdly, how does an Undergrad and general Uni apps work? My current perception is that you apply early grade 12, using predicted IB scores, and the ones already resulting from the exam (in my case Chemistry and Business) in Grade 11. Then, you submit a CASPer or a Personality Evaluation, and an MCAT? I'm really looking for a view on how the process works. So, MCAT or no, GPA from IB, and how to apply.

I am hesitant to take this decision for a few reasons, 1) My current math teacher is the best our school has to offer and getting physics will switch me into another math class. 2) Many students only take 11 Physics anyways, so it might not even be worth risking it if I am only going to take it for once year. 3) Semester becomes crowded: Accounting, Math, Bio, Phys.
